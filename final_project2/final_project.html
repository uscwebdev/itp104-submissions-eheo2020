    <p>The rich artistic tapestry of Korean culture, globally acknowledged today, is a result of a gradual evolution. Originating from the diverse artifacts and tomb murals of the Three Kingdoms Period, this artistic sensibility flourished through the eras of Unified Silla (676–935), Goryeo (918–1392), and Joseon (1392–1910). The continuity of this artistic DNA has been passed down through generations to present-day Koreans. South Korea safeguards a trove of invaluable cultural heritage, with over 50 items inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage List, designating them as either World Heritage Sites, Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, or included in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register as of 2020.

    <h4>Start Exploring</h4>
    <p>The UNESCO lists are a great place to start when exploring Korean history and culture, either on your trip to Korea or from home. You can find a comprehensive list of the recognised Korean heritage sites and cultural traditions on the 
        <a href="https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/main/index.do">Korea Tourism Organisation </a> website, but in this article we have selected a few prominent examples from each category as an initial introduction to the vibrant cultural heritage of Korea.
